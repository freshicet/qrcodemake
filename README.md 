# URL QR Generator Chrome Extension

A simple Chrome extension that builds a URL using user inputs (Base ID, Client ID, First Name, Last Name) and generates a QR code for easy scanning.

---

## Features

- **Form fields** for:
  - Base ID (with toggle to include/exclude)
  - Client ID
  - First Name
  - Last Name
- **URL construction**: Builds a URL of the form:
  
  ```text
  https://bob.com?baseid=<BaseID>&clientid=<ClientID>&fname=<FirstName>&lname=<LastName>
  ```
- **QR code generation** using the [QRious](https://github.com/neocotic/qrious) library.
- **Persistence** of Base ID in `chrome.storage.local` until the extension is reloaded.
- **Automatic clearing** of Base ID on each extension reload via a background service worker.
